# PBS-1
*requirements
1. Download python 
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Download yolov3.weights file from ![https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights] & put it in models directory/folder.
4. Run command "python main.py"(no need to run any other file)
5. It'll show a window, draw a frame there using 4 red dots & draw some point of reference for algorithm using 4 blue dots, After this step this window will automaticelly close
6. A new window with title Bird's eye view(Top View) will appear & show top-view for each iteration of algorithm, will also add labelled images in output folder, output_vid folder is of no use
7. You may need to stop algorithm using "Ctrl + C"(KeyboardInterrupt), as it'll run for long time & use your systems resources, so after training for like 50-100 iterations/ images stop interrupt the program
